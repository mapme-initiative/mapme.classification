Description: This packages offers some functionality for reoccuring tasks in
  spatial-temporal model building and prediction. The full cycle from predictor extraction,
  train-test split, cross-validation as well as post-processing and area estimation adjustment
  is supported. It relies heavliy on functionality provided by the terra, caret and CAST packages,
  thus supporting a very high number of different machine learning algorithms. 
  The package is part of the MAPME toolset at <https://github.com/mapme-initiative/> 
  and was developed by MapTailor Geospatial Consulting <https://maptailor.net/>.
